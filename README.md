# terraform-eks-lab

Use terraform to build an EKS cluster in AWS.

Build, or download a simple container that provides an HTTP endpoint and deploy it to the cluster using any method you are comfortable with

Configure the cluster (via terraform) to expose this endpoint to the internet so it can be accessed from a browser or via curl

Optional Extras

These can either be implemented, or a detailed explanation of how it would be achieved should be discussed in the interview

·         Expose an HTTPS endpoint with a valid certificate

·         Automatically generate a DNS name for the container
